# Roll-Dice-Game
 Rule of the Roll-Dice-Game: 2 Player roll the dice, if dice is different than 1: 
 The score of dice will be add into current score 
 Otherwise dice equal 1 then your current score will be 0 and switch to next player
 When The score of dice will be add into current score, you have 2 options:
 Continue roll the dice and increase the current score, Note danger: you can lost all the current score if get dice = 1;
 OR you can press the hold button to hold the current score and it will be add into your total score and don't fear about lost current score;
 But you will lost your turn 
 Finally, Player get total score >= 50 the soonest will be a winner!
 And you can also play again the game by press New Game button.
 Thanks!
